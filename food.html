     <h1>Food</h1>

     <p class="food-intro">I am not a picky eater. When it comes to food, I like almost anything (except maybe oysters or clams--I've never tried them but they gross me out). I enjoy my mom's cooking, but without access to her recipes, I thought I would share my favorite restaurants to eat at. I apologize if these aren't close to you!</p>

     <div class="row">
         <img class="placeholder" src="images/101bk.jpg" alt="A plate of fries from 101 Beer Kitchen">
         <div class="column">
            <h2 class="restaurant-name">101 Beer Kitchen</h2>
            <p class="food">101 Beer Kitchen has five different locations in Ohio and Indiana and offers a seasonal menu with delicious, handcrafted comfort food. I get something different every time I go, but I'm never disappointed.</p>

     <div class="row">
        <img class="placeholder" src="images/roosters.jpg" alt="A plate of wings from Roosters">
        <div class="column">
           <h2 class="restaurant-name">Roosters</h2>
           <p class="food">Roosters has been my family's go-to for years. It's a fun sports bar where you can always expect crispy fries and hearty wings. I order the same thing every time: boneless wings with medium sauce and a side of curly fries.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <img class="placeholder" src="images/bibibop.jpg" alt="A bowl from Bibipop">
        <div class="column">
           <h2 class="restaurant-name">Bibibop</h2>
           <p class="food">Bibibop serves healthy and affordable Asian food. You can customize your bowl to exactly how you want it. I like to get rice, chicken, potatoes, plenty of vegetables, and yum yum sauce on mine.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <img class="placeholder" src="images/brassica.jpg" alt="A bowl from Brassica">
        <div class="column">
           <h2 class="restaurant-name">Brassica</h2>
           <p class="food">Brassica serves sandwiches on housemade pita or salads with lentils and rice. You can customize your order with a variety of options, such as falafel, chicken, brisket, hummus, and many scrumptious vegetables. I recommend getting their fries too!</p>

    <div class="row">
        <img class="placeholder" src="images/bjs.jpg" alt="A chocolate chip pizookie from BJ's">
        <div class="column">
           <h2 class="restaurant-name">BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse</h2>
           <p class="food">With an incredibly large menu, there's something for everyone at BJ's. But the main reason I go is to get their delicious pizookie dessert: a warm, oven-baked pizza cookie with ice cream that melts over the top. My stomach's growling thinking about it!</p>

    <div class="row">
        <img class="placeholder" src="images/macandjoes.jpg" alt="Hamburger and onion rings from Mac & Joe's">
        <div class="column">
           <h2 class="restaurant-name">Mac & Joe's</h2>
           <p class="food">Mac & Joe's has a special place in my heart as it's located right in my college town of Oxford, Ohio. It serves the best bar food, offering hamburgers, sandwiches, wings, and more. Ask for their tater tots and spicy aioli on the side!</p>
